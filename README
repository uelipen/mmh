Last updated August 25, 2000, by Ue-Li Pen, pen@cita.utoronto.ca

Most recent update: OpenMP version added by Pengjie Zhang.  Compiles
fine with SGI f77 7.3, scales up to 64 processors on 256^3 problems,
or 32 processors for 128^3.

For algorithmic description, see ApJS, 115, 19 (1998)
or astro-ph/9704258.

0. COPYRIGHT

This code may be used freely for scientific studies, subject to the
acknowledgement request above.  Parts of this package are taken from
Ed Bertschinger's P3M system, in particular the generic FFT wrappers
and the gif file generation.  Please see the copyright notice in file
genericfft.f for further information.


1. INSTALLATION:

the supplied default Makefile compiles on DEC alphas.  Use
make ARCH={SGI,KF77,GENERIC} for sgi, KAP, and generic compilers
respectively.  Alternative, use 'setenv ARCH=SGI' and run 'make', or
edit the makefile.

An FFT is used for the grid limiter.  A standard one is supplied,
but the specific architectures usually have libraries which are five
times faster.

You may need custom compilation flags for other architectures.  
Shared memory parallel machines should all be straightforward for porting.

type 'make run' to compile and run.

the file 'dimen.fh' defines the box size.

file 'COSMOPAR.DAT' sets the cosmological parameters, and uses BBKS
initial conditions.


2. RUN TIME:

The run parameters are specified in file COSMOPAR.DAT
Compressmax is the grid compression limiter.  Should be a value less than 20.
The run time is proportional to that value.

All results and checkpoint files during the run are stored in binary
files ending in '*chk.dat'.  If a run is started in a directory
containing the file 'state_chk.dat', the program will attempt to
restart from the last checkpoint.

short overview of the run time output:
on startup, when on  an SGI ORIGIN series, it may report something
about the number of processors it thinks the machine has.  This can be
safely ignored.

each time step the output line contains information of the
following kind:

't' is proper time on the scale 0-1
'tau' is the grid time on scale (-\infty,-3]
the first 'relaxerr' is the grid deformation multigrid iterator residual.
	It should be multiplied by dtau to give a dimensionless error estimate.
        The actual value does not affect any physical quantity.
'cmax' is the maximal compression ratio (typically a bit larger than
	'compressmax'/(1+z)).
'rgmin,max' are the smallest and largest cell volumes, dimensionless
 	relative to 1.
'rhomnx' are the masses in the least and most massive cell
'... times' are the number of cells which are at least as dense as
	'compressmax'/(1+z)
'sumenergy' is the ratio of total particle energy to gas energy.
the second and third 'relaxerr' are for the gravity solver, and are 
	dimensionless.  If they get bigger than 1, there is probably
	a problem.  The multigrid is applied twice, and the second residual
	should be smaller than the first.
'KE' is kinetic energy of the gas
'TE' is thermal energy of gas
'PE' is potential energy
'R' is the Layzer-Irvine energy ratio.  Should be near 1.  I think its errors
	are dominated by low density regions, so modest deviations should
	not be a problem.

Sometimes some lines are added:
'cold fraction' is only displayed with the '-DCOLD' compiler option.
	The fraction of the grid cells which is treated as cold dust.
'cd/c=' if the grid convergence time is shorter than the sound speed limit.

3. POSTPROCESSING

output processing can be done with various routines in subdirectory
'POSTPROCESSING'.  

file gasmap.f90 generates an ascii file containing gas mass and
positions, which can be treated as particles.

File prhopspect.f90 measures the power spectrum of the dark matter,
and optionally that of the gas density.

the program cluster.f reads the final checkpoint data, and outputs a
list of clusters (it is only tested to work for z=0).

eulercompare.f extracts a cross section onto a high resolution eulerian
grid using an inverse mapping procedure.

4. PARALLEL CONSIDERATIONS

when running in parallel, good speedup is only obtained if the number of
threads requested is smaller than the number of free CPUs on the system.
If any thread get less than 100% cpu share, the total speed can degrade
dramatically.
